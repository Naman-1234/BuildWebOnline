# Learning
Building this project and solving the errors came along was a beautiful journey. This is a great project to anyone who wants to make his/her skills better in MERN Stack or Sole Frontend and Backend.
Through this I got to learn more about
- Mongoose
    1. Functions calling on instance and statistics.
    2. Function calling Before Saving and After Saving of data in a database.
    3. Validators and Types in Mongoose.
- Postman
    1. One thing which I did in this project is I made almost all of the Backend before even starting on Frontend. Through this I was able to learn Postman to a great extend, Some of them are:
       - Made different https verbs(get,post,patch,delete).
       - Environments in Postman.
       - Setting authentication in Postman.

### I will continue working on this project and will add some more features:
- Testing using Jest.
- Giving Options of Logging through other Platforms like Google, Github etc if possible.
- Setting Document Visible to all if user permits, to make others see that amazing project.
